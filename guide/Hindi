It's really cool that freeCodeCamp has its curriculum translated into Arabic, Chinese, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.
I believe this is important because it allows for many more people around the world who aren't fluent or don't know english to learn code.
With that being said, I also think the curriculum should be translated into Hindi. 
Hindi is the 4th most spoken language in the world with over 300 million speakers world wide. 
Something tells me this translation would get done quite fast! ;)
